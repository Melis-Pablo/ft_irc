# ft_irc

## üí¨ Project Overview

ft_irc is a network programming project focused on implementing a functional Internet Relay Chat (IRC) server from scratch using C++98. The project demonstrates understanding of network protocols, socket programming, and concurrent client handling without using threads or forking.

The server handles multiple clients simultaneously using non-blocking I/O operations and implements core IRC functionality including user authentication, channel management, private messaging, and operator privileges. All communication follows the IRC protocol standards, making it compatible with existing IRC clients.

## üèóÔ∏è Server Architecture

### Core Components
- **Socket Management**: TCP/IP server socket handling multiple client connections
- **Client Handler**: Non-blocking client connection management
- **Channel System**: Multi-user chat rooms with operator privileges
- **Command Parser**: IRC protocol command processing and validation
- **User Authentication**: Nickname, username, and password verification

### Network Architecture
- Single-threaded event-driven architecture using poll() (or equivalent)
- Non-blocking I/O operations for all socket communications
- TCP/IP (v4 or v6) communication protocol
- Efficient handling of partial data reception and transmission

### IRC Features
- **User Management**: Authentication, nicknames, and user states
- **Channel Operations**: Join, leave, and message broadcasting
- **Private Messaging**: Direct user-to-user communication
- **Operator Commands**: Channel moderation and administration
- **Error Handling**: Proper IRC error responses and edge case management

### Supported IRC Commands

#### Basic Commands
- **PASS**: Server password authentication
- **NICK**: Set or change nickname
- **USER**: Set username and real name
- **JOIN**: Join a channel
- **PART**: Leave a channel
- **PRIVMSG**: Send private messages
- **QUIT**: Disconnect from server

#### Operator Commands
- **KICK**: Remove user from channel
- **INVITE**: Invite user to invite-only channel
- **TOPIC**: Set or view channel topic
- **MODE**: Modify channel settings
  - `i`: Invite-only mode
  - `t`: Topic restriction to operators
  - `k`: Channel password/key
  - `o`: Grant/revoke operator status
  - `l`: Set user limit

### Design Principles

The server follows these architectural principles:
- **Single-Threaded**: No forking or threading for client handling
- **Event-Driven**: poll() or equivalent for efficient I/O multiplexing
- **Non-Blocking I/O**: All socket operations are non-blocking
- **Protocol Compliance**: Follows IRC RFC specifications
- **Memory Safety**: Proper resource management and error handling

### Socket Programming

The server implements low-level socket operations:
- TCP socket creation and binding
- Non-blocking socket configuration
- Client connection acceptance
- Efficient data transmission and reception
- Proper connection cleanup and error handling

### Command Processing

IRC commands are processed through:
- Message parsing and validation
- Command routing and execution
- Response generation and transmission
- Error handling and user feedback

### Channel Management

Channels provide multi-user communication:
- Dynamic channel creation and destruction
- User membership tracking
- Message broadcasting to channel members
- Operator privilege management
- Mode and setting enforcement

## üöÄ Usage

### Prerequisites
- C++ compiler (g++ or clang++)
- Make
- IRC client (HexChat, WeeChat, irssi, or similar)
- Unix-like operating system

### Compilation and Setup

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/username/ft_irc.git
cd ft_irc

# Compile the server
make

# Start the IRC server
./ircserv <port> <password>

# Example
./ircserv 6667 mypassword
```

### Connecting with IRC Client

```bash
# Using HexChat, WeeChat, or any IRC client
# Server: localhost (or your server IP)
# Port: 6667 (or your chosen port)
# Password: mypassword (your server password)

# Example with nc for testing
nc localhost 6667
PASS mypassword
NICK mynick
USER myuser 0 * :My Real Name
JOIN #general
PRIVMSG #general :Hello, world!
```

### Makefile Commands

| Command       | Description                           |
|---------------|---------------------------------------|
| `make`        | Compile the IRC server                |
| `make all`    | Same as make                          |
| `make clean`  | Remove object files                   |
| `make fclean` | Remove object files and executable    |
| `make re`     | Recompile from scratch                |
